        <h1>OCR Project in C: Collaborative Achievement</h1>

        <p>In a collaborative effort, our team successfully developed an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using the C programming language. Notably, we built this OCR from scratch without relying on external libraries.</p>

        <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> Implemented advanced techniques for image preprocessing.</li>
            <li><strong>Character Segmentation:</strong> Achieved precise segmentation of characters from images.</li>
            <li><strong>Pattern Matching:</strong> Utilized custom algorithms for accurate character recognition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges Overcome:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Algorithmic Complexity:</strong> Managed complexities in designing algorithms for diverse fonts and styles.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Optimization:</strong> Ensured efficient memory usage for improved performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Outcome:</h2>
        <p>Our team's dedication resulted in a functional OCR system capable of accurately recognizing text from various images. This project not only enhanced our programming skills but also provided valuable insights into computer vision and image processing.</p>

        <h1>A Long Night - A Unity Horror Game</h1>

        <p>During our Unity game development project, my team and I created an immersive horror experience called "Deadly Escape." The game challenges players to navigate through a haunted house while avoiding a relentless killer. One of the most exciting features is the multiplayer option, adding a thrilling social dimension to the horror.</p>

        <h2>Game Overview:</h2>
        <p>"Deadly Escape" immerses players in a chilling atmosphere with carefully crafted graphics and a suspenseful soundtrack. Each player takes on the role of a character trapped in a sinister house, tasked with the sole objective of escaping alive.</p>

        <p>The unpredictable killer patrols the house, creating constant tension. Players must use their ingenuity to find clues, solve puzzles, and unlock secret passages while avoiding the killer. Cooperation between players is crucial for survival, adding a strategic element to the game.</p>

        <h2>Multiplayer Features:</h2>
        <p>What sets "Deadly Escape" apart is the ability to play in multiplayer mode. Players can team up, strategize, and escape the killer together. Communication is key as coordinated movements and actions are vital for success.</p>

        <p>Multiplayer sessions offer a variety of tactics, from diversion to coordinated escape routes. This creates a dynamic and interactive gaming experience, where each session is unique based on player choices and actions.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>"Deadly Escape" goes beyond a typical Unity horror game in C#. It represents the culmination of a passionate team's work, dedicated to delivering a memorable experience. With its eerie atmosphere, challenging puzzles, and captivating multiplayer mode, the game promises thrills and suspense for those daring enough to enter this virtual haunted house.</p>
